<br>
<b>WEB Page</b>
<br>
<br> A web page is text document written in a language called <b>HTML</b>,
or <b>HyperText Markup Language</b>. Web browsers read these documents and then interpret and display them.
<br>
<br>
<b>Coding</b>
<br>
<br>
Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. We learned some simple coding using <b>HTML</b> <b>Tags</b>, <b>Elements</b>, & <b>Attributes</B>. 
<br>
<b>Tag</b> : A tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (for example &lt; b &gt; and a closing tag &lt; /b &gt; ). 
Some tags do not require a closing tag (like the &lt; br &gt;, line break tag).
They are called <em>"void''</em> tags.
<br>
<b>Element</b>: An element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags
<br>
<b>Attribute</b>: An attribute is a property of an element, used to set the <em>href</em> attribute on an anchor tag. Used for making links, URL resources.

I also learned to add pictures to my page <img src="http://i.imgur.com/Sjmtk4kb.jpg" alt="May the Force be with you!">

<b>Computers are stupid</b>
<br>
<br>
Computers need to be told exactly what to do, using the correct "syntax". If you forget to close a &lt; b &gt; tag <b> the computer will not be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold.
It could be very frustrating and sometimes time consuming. Did I mention computers are stupid?

<br>
<b>The Internet</b>
<br>
<br>
People use browser to request data from servers via the Internet. The servers return the information back to the browser which interprets the data.
